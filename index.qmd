Welcome to the website! 

I am a political science graduate with a minor in history from John Cabot University. Throughout my university career, I have had the pleasure of working closely with professors as they did their own projects furthering my own understand of academia, this allowed me to apply theory into hard practice. These projects included research assistantships on peace and secrecy, as well as Imperial Borderlands, a cambridge published book on extractive institutions.
