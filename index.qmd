Welcome to the website!  

Hello! I am a Political Science major with a passion for comparative politics from my background as well my time in john Cabot University. Throughout my university career I have focused on Democratic Theory, the connection between Religion and Politics, Security Studies, as well as Middle Eastern Political Dynamics I have also traveled to Volda, Norway in a direct exchange program between my home university as well as Volda University College where I spent half of 2022 studying the European Union. Between the two institutions in my university years, I have also been involved with research projects undertaken with my professors, one of which include a pioneering study on Peace and Secrecy.

I am also a Professional Photographer specializing in events and landscapes, Registered Drone Pilot, and I am also very comfortable with Adobe applications such as Lightroom, Photoshop, and even more advanced Color Grading software such as DaVinci Resolve.
