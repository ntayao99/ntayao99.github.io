In a pioneering research project co-funded by the Norwegian Foreign Ministry entitled "Inclusivity and secrecy: Governing information flows when negotiating peace in complex conflict contexts", I was involved in a team that gathered literature concerning the Oslo Process, Security Studies concerns in the Middle East, as well as how the confidentiality practices has evolved over time. In a program hosted by John Cabot University in collaboration with the research lead in the European Union Institute as well as experts in Norway, I was a contributor to the study in for a contracted semester.
